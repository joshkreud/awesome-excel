### Tables

Should be the Preferred way to store data, if the count of entries is variable.
Also they integrate perfectly with PivotTables.

## Power Query

Was an add-in until Excel 2010, is now in the Data Tab.
Query and Transform data from different sources. (Also used in PowerBI)
I mainly use it to get data from one or multiple other Workbooks.
It basically generates Excel Tables (see above) and updates them.
Very useful, for example if you have a changing data source and want to always display all the unique entries in a column.
Also useful to transform data into a Pivot Table friendly format without changing the source data.
